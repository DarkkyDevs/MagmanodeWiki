```

## 2. Giving Permissions Inside the Panel

To Do This you Need to Go To The Magmanode Panel, Next Open Up The Users Tab and Select "Add User" Now you can add your friend's Email here and give them certain permissions.

{% hint style="info" %}
Please use the Email they used to Login to Magmanode

Also there is no invitations that will be sent to their email they just get access immediately they just need to go to panel.magmanode.com
{% endhint %}
